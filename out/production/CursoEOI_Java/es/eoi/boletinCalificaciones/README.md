This exercise is based on the "facturacion" program we worked on in 
class (also present in this repository).

It is a grade paper with a specific structure. It uses java classes and enumerators.
Moreover, the user needs to input student data and subject and grades through the console.
The program then prints out the whole paper on the console.

This is the first exercise for grades which we had to work on individually 
and present to the professor.

I will keep working on this as I learn more things.
